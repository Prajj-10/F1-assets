      "biography": "Born in London but racing under the flag of Thailand, Alexander Albon’s first word was in fact Italian. That word was Ferrari – though it was with another Italian team that he got his big F1 break.\nIdolising Michael Schumacher and dreaming of one day racing in Formula 1, the junior Albon was pipped to the 2016 GP3 title by a certain Charles Leclerc. He then left his great friendship with George Russell trackside as he took the 2018 Formula 2 title fight down to the wire.\nGraduating to the F1 big league along with yet another contemporary – Lando Norris – in 2019, Albon did his talking on track with Toro Rosso in the opening races, earning a mid-season promotion to Red Bull Racing.\nA stylish overtaker with a championship mentality, Albon was unfazed by partnering Max Verstappen for the second half of his rookie season, taking top-six finishes in eight of his nine 2019 races with Red Bull.\nStaying in touch with the future champion proved tougher in 2020 and Red Bull dropped him from their race line-up. Crucially, though, Albon was retained as test and reserve driver, keeping him very much on team bosses’ radar, leading to his 2022 return to the grid with Williams, where he has established a reputation as a fast qualifier and mature racer.\nLaidback and cheerful with a cheeky grin, the Thai driver is popular among his peers – not always easy in motorsport’s cauldron of competition – but you don’t succeed in Formula 1 by being popular. Albon’s challenge remains a big one – to make the most of a rare second F1 opportunity."

This calm temperament follows him off track where he remains unfazed by the pressures of forging a Grand Prix career with a famous name.\nSainz is the son of double World Rally champion, also his namesake, and has brought some of Dad’s driving skills to the F1 circuit – junior loves a delicious dose of drift for one.\nAfter following in his famous father’s tyre tracks, Sainz has had big racing boots to fill – first at McLaren where he replaced his childhood hero Fernando Alonso, and now at Ferrari, in the seat formerly owned by Sebastian Vettel.\nIt is never easy living in the shadow of sporting giants, but Sainz has shown the drive and disposition to deal with it, scoring four Grand Prix victories during his time with Scuderia seasons before moving to his latest challenge at Williams.

The Briton stormed to the 2017 GP3 championship and delivered the 2018 Formula 2 crown under immense pressure.\nSpotting his potential, world champions Mercedes swooped to sign him to their junior programme in 2017, when Russell already had a DTM deal on the table. He banked more experience with practice sessions with Force India and tests for the Silver Arrows, before landing his Mercedes-powered Williams race drive.\nA refusal to cede ground to his rivals - and commitment to a tricky pass – underpins Russell’s winning mentality. And it’s what got him the call-up to replace Lewis Hamilton for a one-off Mercedes appearance for Sakhir 2020 when the reigning champ was struck down by Covid-19.\nThat star turn saw Russell miss out on pole by just 0.026s and then outrace Mercedes stalwart Valtteri Bottas. Only a bungled pit stop and a heart-breaking late puncture prevented a near-certain maiden win for the up-and-coming super-sub.\nHe kept his head down at Williams in 2021, scoring his first points and podium, all the while keeping his eye on the bigger prize. Having proved himself a hard worker and a tenacious talent, that prize arrived in the form of a chance to take on compatriot and seven-time champion Hamilton in identical machinery.\nIt was an opportunity Russell has relished, and he took his first F1 win – and Mercedes’ only 2022 victory – in Brazil. The 2023 season proved tougher, but he was again atop the podium twice in 2024 and for 2025 he leads the team following Hamilton's departure for Ferrari.\nAnd if the Silver Arrows can bounce back and provide a truly competitive car, a title bid surely beckons - a huge challenge, but as always, ‘Russell the Rocket’ will be going flat out."

Winning back-to-back championships also taught Leclerc how to handle pressure, another useful tool in the big pond of Formula 1 racing.\nStepping up to F1 in 2018, Leclerc showed flashes of ballistic pace on Saturdays and racing brilliance on Sundays, dragging his Sauber beyond its limits – and earning himself a money-can’t-buy race seat at Ferrari for 2019, stepping into the shoes of the Scuderia’s last world champion, Kimi Raikkonen.\nThere he immediately put the cat among the proverbial pigeons, unafraid to go wheel-to-wheel with established number one, Sebastian Vettel. A maiden F1 victory at Spa was followed by another a week later on Ferrari’s hallowed home turf of Monza. The tifosi had found another new hero – who then became the first man to out-score Vettel over a season with the Scuderia, a feat he repeated in crushing fashion the following year.\nThe 2020 and ’21 seasons bore little fruit for Ferrari, but Leclerc maintained his resolve to emerge a true title contender in 2022. With three wins, 11 podiums and nine pole positions, he was the only man able to consistently take the fight to champion Max Verstappen - a feat he and the Scuderia were sadly unable to repeat in subsequent campaigns.\nOut of the car, Leclerc is modest and thoughtful - but then he is on his own very personal mission. This exciting young talent is racing for his late father Herve and his friend and mentor Jules Bianchi, the F1 driver who died in 2015.\nOn the evidence so far, he is doing them both proud."

Few would deny that he’s in the conversation – and what’s more he’s got there his way, twinning his relentless speed with a refusal to conform to stereotypes for how a racing driver should think, dress or behave.\nRespect is hard earned in F1, but Hamilton – Sir Lewis Hamilton to be precise – has it from every one of his peers.

It was going to take someone very special to topple the Ferrari legend from his throne – and that it was Fernando Alonso who did it, tells you all you need to know about the Spaniard.\nFiercely competitive, Alonso is not shy about his talent, rating himself as 9/10 “in everything”, and few in the know would disagree, with his performances in F1 characterised by blistering speed, brilliant tactical thinking, exemplary race craft, a razor-sharp eye for detail and a relentless determination to win.\nA serial record breaker in his early days, he was – at one time – F1’s youngest polesitter, race winner, world champion and double world champion as he gobbled up success with the Renault team. Even Alonso couldn’t continue that amazing run in his later career though, failing to add another title to his collection despite spells at McLaren and Ferrari.\nBut after two years away from Formula 1 racing – and with two Le Mans wins in his pocket – Alonso returned with Alpine in 2021. His speed and determination undiminished, he was back on the podium that year, but frustrated by poor reliability – and the lack of a long-term contract – the following season, he opted to jump ship once more.\nAfter eight podiums in his first season with Aston Martin, he has since become the first man to reach 400 Grand Prix starts. And with tech legend Adrian Newey joining in 2025, Alonso now hopes it will be with the team in green that he finally returns to winning ways, as he has unfinished business with F1…"

An opportunistic racer he bounded onto the podium in Baku, the youngest rookie to do so. As the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, Stroll is used to a champagne lifestyle but now he knows the fizz tastes all the sweeter on the rostrum. Then in Monza he mastered the downpours to become the youngest driver in history to line up on the front row.\n A single-minded starter, the Canadian loves to make up places on the opening lap and fight through to the points. Stroll has the potential to be a long-term fixture in Formula 1 – as amply illustrated by a maiden pole and another two podiums in 2020.\nThose came after his father Lawrence led the consortium that took over Force India midway through the 2018 season, and then transformed it from Racing Point to Aston Martin for 2021.

British F4 runner-up. Formula Renault champion. F3 champion. F2 champion (by more than 50 points).

      "biography": "Gabriel Bortoleto will carry the hopes of a nation during his debut F1 season, with the reigning F2 champion becoming the first Brazilian to compete in the sport full-time since Felipe Massa in 2017.\nBorn in Sao Paulo, Bortoleto started karting aged seven and was soon winning local championships – his businessman father Lincoln Oliveira, who is involved in Brazilian motor racing, providing valuable support.\nJust four years later, Bortoleto was on his way to Europe, where he followed in the footsteps of hero Ayrton Senna by achieving further karting success in international championships and paving the way for a move to single-seaters.\nSince then, Bortoleto has won races in almost every category he has contested, initially building his experience in Italian F4 and Formula Regional through 2021 and 2022, and doing enough to be signed by Fernando Alonso’s A14 management company.\nWith Alonso in his corner, Bortoleto moved up a gear, brilliantly capturing back-to-back F3 and F2 titles in 2023 and 2024 – the latter season including a remarkable rise from last to first during the Monza Feature Race.\nIt was a performance that got the paddock talking and saw him emerge as an outside contender for one of the then few vacancies on the 2025 F1 grid.\nBortoleto’s situation was complicated slightly by his driver development deal with McLaren, signed shortly after he won the F3 title, but given their locked down duo of race winners Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, team chiefs did not want to stand in the youngster’s way.\nAs such, whispers of a potential move to Kick Sauber – following a company-wide evaluation by new team boss Mattia Binotto – soon turned into concrete news, and Bortoleto was duly confirmed alongside the experienced Nico Hulkenberg.\nBortoleto hailed an “amazing feeling” when he made his official F1 test debut for Sauber at the 2024 post-season gathering in Abu Dhabi, with the 20-year-old now eager to turn his Formula 1 dreams into a reality…"

      "biography": "If there’s one word that dominates Esteban Ocon’s career, it’s ‘sacrifice’.\nBack when he was just a promising karter, Ocon’s parents sold their house, put their jobs on hold, and began a life on the road, living in a caravan and travelling from circuit to circuit to support their son’s burgeoning career.\nSacrifice, see – but it worked. 2014 saw Ocon break through in the world of single-seaters, as he beat a certain Max Verstappen to the European F3 title. Backed by Mercedes, he won the GP3 title the following year and was halfway through a season of DTM in 2016 when he was offered the chance to replace Rio Haryanto at the minnow Manor team from the Belgian Grand Prix onwards.\nThat opportunity led to a full-time seat the following year with Force India, where his wheel-to-wheel duels with highly-rated team mate Sergio Perez quickly marked him out as a rising star. But when Lawrence Stroll, father of racer Lance, stepped in midway through 2018 to secure the squad’s financial future, the writing was on the wall for Ocon, who was moved aside at the end of the year to allow Stroll Jnr to join from Williams.\nOcon bided his time, though, and after a year on the sidelines as Mercedes’ reserve driver, he found his way back into a race seat for 2020 with Renault, who became Alpine for 2021 – when his wait finally paid off, as he scored his – and the famous French marque’s – first F1 win.\nNothing in Ocon’s motorsport career has come easy – but if Ocon has managed to return to the F1 grid and step atop the podium, it’s through a combination of self-belief, determination and a talent that’s up there with the very best."

A further 21 races into his fledgling career, Gasly was moved up again – this time to replace Red Bull big gun Daniel Ricciardo.\nGasly seemed to have a knack of being in the right place at the right time – a quality that’s equally handy on track. A series of impressive 2018 performances for Toro Rosso – including a brilliant fourth place in Bahrain – showed exciting promise for what he might do with the ‘A’ team in 2019.\nUnfortunately that promise only appeared in flashes – and he quickly suffered from unfavourable comparisons with superstar team mate Max Verstappen. So much so that after the summer break, he was sent back to Toro Rosso, with another young up-and-comer – Alex Albon – being given a shot in the ‘senior’ Red Bull seat.\nBut Gasly bounced back, as only Gasly can. In the season’s remaining nine races he scored almost as many points as team mate Kvyat managed over the entire year – and secured his best-ever race result with P2 in Brazil. That trajectory continued in 2020, peaking with an emotional maiden win at the renamed AlphaTauri team’s home race in Italy, and didn’t let up in 2021 when he was back on the podium and scored 110 of the squad’s 142 points.\nWhen AlphaTauri’s momentum stalled in 2022, Gasly decided it was time for a change – in the form of French squad Alpine. It’s a move that has occasionally put him back on the podium, but the question now is can he gather momentum and get himself another shot at the F1 bigtime…"

But he didn’t have to wait long to be back on the grid, replacing rookie Jack Doohan for at least five Grands Prix from round seven onwards."

The following year he was up to third, thanks to three race wins, including impressive back-to-back feature race victories in Hungary and Belgium.\nFormula 1 experience came via Alpine, with free practice outings at Grands Prix in 2022, 2023 and 2024. And having served his apprenticeship with the French squad, Doohan’s reward was a shot at the big time as team mate to F1 race winner Pierre Gasly.\nBut a tough start to the 2025 campaign saw him fail to make an impact and after six rounds Alpine chose to ‘rotate’ him with former Williams racer Franco Colapinto. Back in a reserve role, only time will tell if Doohan gets another chance of Grand Prix glory."
